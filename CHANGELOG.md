# LrMediaWiki changelog

## v0.4.1: Bugfix for Lightroom 6.2

This bugfix releases fixes a typo that caused errors in the new Lightroom version.

### Fixed issues

 - #46: Malformed ZString (missing trailing quote)

## v0.4: Keywords, galleries, updates – and configuration (2015-06-28)

This release adds a configuration section to the plugin settings dialog. In this
section, you can configure the creation of export snapshots (before: always on),
the creation of export keywords (new feature), an automatic update check on
Lightroom starts (new feature) and logging (before: manual activation in a
Lua file). Hopefully, the next version will be the first stable release v1.0!

### Fixed issues

 - #24: Add gallery option (enhancement)
 - #31: Add configuration section in the export dialog (enhancement)
 - #34: Add custom tag when exporting (enhancement)
 - #44: Check for new versions after start (enhancement)

## v0.3.1: Bugfix and beauty (2015-06-27)

Fixes some bugs introduced by the last release v0.3 and aligns the export
dialog more properly.

### Fixed issues
 - #43: Fix errors introduced by refactoring (bug)

## v0.3: Errors (2015-06-27)

This release adds improved error handling or even avoids errors. For example,
the error messages for a missing network connection and for API warnings are
improved. And if the image title contains consecutive spaces or underscores, the
upload will no longer fail without a proper error message (but succeed!).

Furthermore, the file description template is moved in a dedicated text file
making it possible to customize it. As some users requested that, the
permission field is added to the export dialog and a development snapshot is
created after the export.

### Fixed issues

 - #26: Add snapshot on export (enhancement)
 - #27: Add permission field to export dialog (enhancement)
 - #28: Check error message when there is no internet connection (enhancement)
 - #29: Move file description template into a file and improve the string
   formatting (enhancement)
 - #30: Overwrite existing files without adding a description (enhancement)
 - #36: Improve error messages for API errors (enhancement)
 - #37: Ensure the image title does not contain consecutive spaces or
  underscores (enhancement)
 - #38: Date format (enhancement)

## v0.2.3: Bugfix (2014-10-06)

This release fixes a bug that caused all uploads to fail under certain
circumstances and adds image sizing and sharpening options to the export
dialog.

### Fixed issues
 - #22: Add image sizing and sharpening option to export dialog (enhancement)
 - #23: [string "MediaWikiApi.lua"]:68: table index is nil (bug)

## v0.2.2: Bundestag (2014-09-08)

This releases brings a few minor changes needed for uploads for the German
Bundestag project.

### Fixed issues

 - #15: Show {{Location}} template in wikitext preview (enhancement)

## v0.2.1: Templates! (2014-08-31)

metadata.

### Fixed issues
